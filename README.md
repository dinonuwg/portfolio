## Build & Deploy to GitHub Pages

Recommended flow (PowerShell):

1) Create a new repository on GitHub under the account `dinonuwg` named `D-Portfolio` (or another name).

2) Locally, initialize git (if not already), add remote, and push:

```powershell
# make sure you're in the project root
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
# replace the URL if you chose a different repo name
git remote add origin https://github.com/dinonuwg/D-Portfolio.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3) The included GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will run on push to `main` and deploy the static web build to the `gh-pages` branch automatically.

Notes:
- The workflow uses `npx expo export:web --output-dir dist` to produce a static `dist` folder that gets deployed.
- You can also build locally with `npx expo export:web --output-dir dist` and verify the `dist` folder before pushing.
- If you prefer full automation (creating the remote repo and pushing for you), I can prepare a small script â€” you'll need to provide a GitHub personal access token (PAT) or perform the remote creation yourself.
